        <h2>What is Hex?</h2>
        <p>Hex, launched in 2019 by Richard Heart, is a blockchain-based Certificate of Deposit (CD) designed to offer high yield returns to users. Hex allows users to stake their tokens for a set period, earning interest that is compounded over time. The rewards for staking are directly proportional to the length of the staking period, encouraging long-term commitment and reducing the availability of tokens on the open market, which in turn can drive up value.</p>
        <p>Hex has been designed to function in a decentralized and transparent manner, with all staking transactions executed through immutable smart contracts. This removes any central authority from managing users' funds, increasing trust and reliability. With PulseChain, staking Hex becomes even more advantageous, as reduced transaction fees mean more cost-effective staking and claiming processes for users. Hex's remarkable growth and community-driven adoption make it a key pillar of the PulseChain ecosystem.</p>
