        <h2>What is PulseX?</h2>
        <p>PulseX is PulseChain’s decentralized exchange (DEX), which allows for easy token swaps and liquidity provision. Unlike traditional exchanges, PulseX leverages blockchain technology to facilitate trades without centralized control. PulseX has an integrated buy-and-burn feature, which helps reduce the overall supply of the PLSX token over time, potentially increasing its value. Yield farming opportunities are also available on PulseX, allowing users to earn rewards for providing liquidity to trading pairs.</p>
        <p>PulseX benefits from PulseChain's low fees and rapid transactions, which make it an attractive platform for both new and experienced investors. By providing an accessible gateway for token swapping, PulseX supports the broader PulseChain ecosystem and ensures sufficient liquidity for a wide variety of tokens. PulseX’s governance model allows token holders to vote on changes, making it a truly community-driven platform.</p>
